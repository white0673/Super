                    <h3>Building Trust</h3>
                    <p>Trust is the foundation of any dragon-rider relationship. Dragons are intelligent and can sense fear or aggression. Approach them calmly and show no signs of hostility.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Approach with caution and respect their space.</li>
                        <li>Use non-threatening gestures like an open hand.</li>
                        <li>Offer food as a sign of friendship.</li>
                        <li>Be patient—trust takes time to build.</li>
